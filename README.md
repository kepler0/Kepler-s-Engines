Kepler's Engines
================

BuildCraft Engines dremt up and created by [Kepler Sticka-Jones](http://github.com/k2b6s9j)


## Planned Engines
### Solar Engine
Isn't it sad that even 'Vanilla' Minecraft beat BuildCraft to the punch on adding Solar to it's power system?!
### Bedrock Engine
An infinite amount of power and lots of it untouchable by those players in Survival mode. I'm in!
### Ender Engine
Harvesting energy from the unknown since /r/infiniteworldproblems. Or I'm I confusing the different unknowns again...
### Explosive Engine
It's not what it sounds like...
