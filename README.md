================

BuildCraft Engines dremt up and created by [Kepler Sticka-Jones](http://github.com/k2b6s9j)


## Planned Engines
### Solar Engine
Isn't it sad that even 'Vanilla' Minecraft beat BuildCraft to the punch on adding Solar to it's power system?!
### Bedrock Engine
An infinite amount of power and lots of it untouchable by those players in Survival mode. I'm in!
### Ender Engine
Harvesting energy from the unknown since [/r/infiniteworldproblems](http://reddit.com/r/infiniteworldproblems). Or I'm I confusing the different unknowns again...
### Explosive Engine
It's not what it sounds like...
### Hydro Engine
Isn't it just slightly rediculous that water, and water alone, can't turn the gears of an engine yet?
### The Unknown Engine
No one knows quite where this gem came from. All that is known is that it is created when someting goes wrong and comes in every varient of engine block.
### Pneumatic Engine
It's kinda like an energy buffer... Or maybe a battery... Whatever it is, it is defenetly not a ripoff of the Redstone Energy Cell.
